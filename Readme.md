- Syntax definition is developed based on the [SublimeHaskell](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell) plugin using the [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) plugin.
- [Interactive editing](http://edwinb.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/interactive-idris-editing-with-vim/) is coming soon...
